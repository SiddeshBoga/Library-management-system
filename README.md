# Library Management System (C)

This project is a **console-based Library Management System** developed
using the C programming language. It was created to demonstrate strong
foundations in C programming, file handling, and structured programming
concepts.

The system allows users to manage book records efficiently using a
menu-driven interface and persistent storage through files.

## Project Overview
The Library Management System is designed to perform basic library
operations such as adding, viewing, and searching for books. The system
stores data in binary files, ensuring that records are preserved between
program executions.

This project focuses on:
- Understanding file handling in C
- Using structures for data organization
- Implementing menu-driven applications
- Handling user input and file I/O safely
